Complete error recovery
Complete Tree Anotation (For instance, the <ID>s of Function() and FunctionAssign() are not stored)

Create Symbol Tables (with the following details): 
	- todas as variáveis globais
	- todas as funcoes declaradas e quantos argumentos têm

	- 1º parsing para as variáveis globais
	- 2º parsing para as variaveis locais

	- Criar class Symbol Table -> hashmap (String, Descriptor[Type, scope])
	- 2 Tipos -> Integer e Array

Do the Semantic Analysis (Run the tree and compare it to the Symbol Tables to do this analysis)

Low Priority:

Use packages, instead of Java's default package
Stop after the first 10 parser errors
Consider outputting "prettier" (i.e., cleaner and more informative) error messages.
Consider rewriting the grammar to avoid use of LOOKAHEADs.
